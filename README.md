This application was built on top of a free to use React template link: https://owaiskhan.me/post/free-tailwindcss-react-ui-kit
Throughout my citations, I will refer to components that were made in the original template, the link above will apply to all.
Each citation will include one of the following, tw Componets/syled components usage are from template. This means only the component design was taken, all other functionality was entered by me.
OR: This file is from the template, this is where nearly all the code in that file is from the template, bar a few changes i made personally.
